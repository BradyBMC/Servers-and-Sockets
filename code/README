We are working together doing pair programming.
All of the work submitted here is code written by us,
except for code copied from the instructor's directories.

We both have read and understood the UC Santa Cruz

We acknowledge that each partner in a programming pair is
responsible for the work performed by the other partner,
and all work has been reviewed by both partners working
together. Both of us know the format of the PARTNER file.

DESCRIPTION

This program creates a client and server to read commands from the 
standard input. The client can use the commands ls, rm, get, put,
help, and exit to interact with the server and it's files.

USAGE

Running 'make' or 'make all' will compile the programs. 
Running 'cxid <port>' in one directory will start the server on that
port.
Running 'cxi <host> <port>' in another directory will start the
client and will be ready to read commands. 
Typing the input help will list the functions and how to use them.
Running 'make clean' will remove all binaries. 
Running 'make spotless' will remove all binary files, cxi, and cxid.
